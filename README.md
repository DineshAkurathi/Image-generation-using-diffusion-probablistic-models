# Image-generation-using-diffusion-probablistic-models

# Overview:

The aim of this project is to implement a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) with the help of various research papers and resources. DPM is a type of probabilistic model that captures the dynamics of a system over time using the idea of random walks, where a particle moves through a space by taking random steps at each time step. In DPM, the particle represents a probability distribution, and the steps represent the evolution of the distribution over time. The project will build upon the existing knowledge of DPM and implement it using the papers and resources provided.

# Goals:

The main goals of the project are as follows:

1. To understand the concept of DPM and its application in machine learning.
2. To implement a DPM using the research papers and resources provided.
3. To test the performance of the DPM on benchmark datasets and compare it with state-of-the-art models.
4. To explore and experiment with different variations and extensions of the DPM.

# Approach:

The following approach will be taken to achieve the goals of the project:

1. Literature Review: A comprehensive review of the research papers and resources related to DPM will be conducted to gain an understanding of the concept and its application in machine learning.

2. Implementation: The DPM will be implemented using the research papers and resources provided. The implementation will be done in Python using deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.

3. Testing and Evaluation: The performance of the DPM will be tested on benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10, MNIST, and ImageNet. The performance metrics such as accuracy, loss, and speed will be evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art models.

4. Extensions and Variations: Different variations and extensions of the DPM will be explored and experimented with to improve its performance and applicability in real-world scenarios.
